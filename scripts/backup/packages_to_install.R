# Offered by Applied Epi (www.appliedepi.org)

# INSTRUCTIONS:
# 1. Ensure you have a good internet connection.  
# 2. Highlight ALL of the text & code in this R script (this entire document).
# 3. Click the "Run" button in the upper-right corner of this pane.
# 4. R will run for some time as it downloads the R packages to your computer.
#    You will see it processing the downloads in the "Console" below.
#    If you see the word "warning" that is generally OK.
#    If you see the word "error", something is wrong.
# 5. After the downloads finish (the ">" appears again in the Console),
#    test it by pasting the below text in the Console and pressing Enter:
#    library(tidyverse)
#    There should be no error message.
# 6. Contact your instructor with questions
